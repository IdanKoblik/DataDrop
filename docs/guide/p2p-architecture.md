# P2P Architecture

Echo's peer-to-peer architecture is the foundation of its performance and privacy advantages. This page explains how Echo's P2P system works and why it matters for file transfers.

## What is Peer-to-Peer?

In a traditional client-server model, all data must flow through central servers:

```
Sender → Central Server → Recipient
```

This creates bottlenecks, single points of failure, and privacy concerns.

With Echo's peer-to-peer model, data flows directly between devices:

```
Sender ↔ Recipient
```

This direct connection offers several advantages:
- Higher transfer speeds
- Enhanced privacy
- Reduced dependency on external infrastructure
- Works in offline environments
