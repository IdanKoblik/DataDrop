# What is Echo?

Echo is a modern peer-to-peer file transfer system designed to make sharing files as simple and secure as possible. Unlike traditional file sharing services that rely on central servers, Echo establishes direct connections between devices, allowing for faster transfers and enhanced privacy.

## Core Principles

Echo was built on three fundamental principles:

1. **Speed** - By eliminating intermediary servers, files travel directly from sender to recipient at the fastest possible speed
2. **Security** - End-to-end encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can access the files
3. **Simplicity** - Designed to be intuitive for everyone, from tech novices to advanced users

## Use Cases

Echo is ideal for a wide range of file transfer scenarios:

- **Local Network Sharing** - Share files with colleagues in the same office
- **Remote Collaboration** - Send large project files to team members anywhere in the world
- **Backup Exchange** - Swap backup files with friends or family
- **Media Distribution** - Share photos and videos without compression
