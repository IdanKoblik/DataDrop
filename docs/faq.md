## Technical Questions

### How does peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer work?

Instead of sending files to a server that then sends them to the recipient, P2P creates a direct connection between the sender and recipient. This offers better speed, privacy, and works even when internet access is limited.

### What's the maximum file size Echo can transfer?

Echo has no built-in size limits. You can transfer files of any size, limited only by your device's storage capacity.

### How fast are transfers with Echo?

Transfer speeds depend on your network connection. Since Echo creates direct connections between devices, you can achieve your network's maximum speed without server-side throttling.
